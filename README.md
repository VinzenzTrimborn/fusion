# Fusion Lab Project
Welcome to the Fusion Lab Project. This project was part of our master studies at TUM. 
The project was developed by a team of 5 students. The goal was to develop a participation concept for rebuilding the Donnersbergerbr√ºcke in Munich.
Within the project we developed a 3D model of the bridge and the surrounding area. The model can be used to visualize the bridge and the surrounding area in a 3D environment within the web application.
Citizens can participate in the project by adding their own ideas and suggestions to the model.
Moreover we ask for feedback at specific parts of the bridge and personal usage information. 

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `src`: Contains the source code of the project
- `src/components`: Contains the components of the project. Most of the components extend the Plasmic generated components.
- `src/components/plasmic`: Contains the code generated by Plasmic
- `src/controls`: Contains our custom controls
- `public`: Contains the public files of the project
- `package.json`: Contains the dependencies of the project

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies and run the project. We have to use --force since ifc.js is not compatible with the current version of r3f. 
Since ifc.js is using wasm files and switched into "that open company" we could not update the package to the latest version.

```bash
npm install --force
npm run start
```
