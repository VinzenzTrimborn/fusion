# Fusion Lab Project
Welcome to the Fusion Lab Project. This project was part of our master studies at TUM. 
The project was developed by a team of 5 students. The goal was to develop a participation concept for rebuilding the Donnersbergerbr√ºcke in Munich.
Within the project we developed a 3D model of the bridge and the surrounding area. The model can be used to visualize the bridge and the surrounding area in a 3D environment within the web application.
Citizens can participate in the project by adding their own ideas and suggestions to the model.
Moreover we ask for feedback at specific parts of the bridge and personal usage information.
